<i><small>Info: {{ info }}<br>
You can do unsupervised clustering or see your stars data without login, <br>
    but for other tools you need login (User -> Sign in/out),<br>
    because tasks are executed in jobs and are private (only owner can see them)

<h1 align="middle">Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome on the Web Interface for Light Curves Classifier - package for classification astronomical objects by using <br>
 Machine Learning methods and downloading stars from huge astronomical  <br>
surveys by using predefined connectors.
Light Curves Classifier is Python package <br>
which can be used directly, by command line interface or by this web interface. <br>
It can be found on <a style="text-decoration:none; color:#0146b5;" href="https://github.com/mavrix93/LightCurvesClassifier">Github</a> or installed
by "pip install lcc". <br> <br>
In order to train classifiers and searching in databases you have to sigin (free and fast), because all these tasks create <br>
a job which is visible just for you without need of waiting on the result (so far all jobs are stored, but in the future some "very old" jobs <br>
will be deleted. Anyway all results can be downloaded. <br>
Also it allows you to create own modules (descriptors, classifiers and even connectors) which can be then used in the Web Interface. <br>
However there are "Unsupervised clustering" and "Showing light curves" section available eve without login.

<h3>Descriptors</h3>

Objects/tools which obtain features for an inspected object from the given data <br>
Example descriptors:
    
<br><br>

<br>
<h4>Curves Shape Descriptor</h4>
<p>Light curves are transformed into words by SAX and compared to the template light curves.<br>
 The dissimilarity  of these two light curves is assigned as the feature to the inspected star.</p> 
<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="{% static 'img/comp_lc_qso.png' %}"></td><td><img src="{% static 'img/comp_lc_bestar.png' %}"></td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Histogram Shape Descriptor</h4>
<p>Histograms of light curves are shifted to have mean magnitude 0 and transformed to have standart deviation 1. <br>
Then it is transformed into words by SAX and compared to the template histograms.<br>
 The dissimilarity  of these two light curves is assigned as the feature to the inspected star.</p> 
<br>
<table><tr><td><img src="{% static 'img/comp_hist_qso.png' %}"></td><td><img src="{% static 'img/comp_hist_bestar.png' %}"></td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Variogram Shape Descriptor</h4>
<p>Time series which represent variation of brightness in different time lags. <br>
It is also transformed into SAX and compared with template variogram.
