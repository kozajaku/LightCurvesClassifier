# Contributing

First of all thank you for considering to contribute! The project is quite big for one person a I would really appreciate any help.

## Code style
 - Just follow PEP8
 - Well because of legacy code package actually use camelCase for class methods (PEP8 alert)
 - Function comments are welcomed and should follow [numpy style](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html)

## Testing
  - `pytest` is preferred
  - Current tests coverage can be definitely improved
  
## Where to contribute

The repo can be divided into 3 areas where it can be contributed:
  1) `lcc` package
  2) `lcc` CLI
  3) Web Interface
  
There are a lots of "ugly" parts of the code which should be refactored...
